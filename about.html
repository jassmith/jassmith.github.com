<p>This site is supposed to be dedicated to producing high quality and in depth technical content for Xamarin.Forms. It is written by Jason Smith, the lead programmer of the product. As such it is quite often not going to include images because he's really crap at doing that kind of thing. It will however contain lots of neat tips and tricks.</p>

<p>In reality this is more than likely going to be a collection of random thoughts, ramblings, and snippets of code about whatever happens to be on my mind as Im making the product.</p>
